The question becomes: which harm is more justifiable given the circumstances?\n\n**Process matters:**\n- Seek counsel from trusted people with relevant experience\n- If time allows, don't rush the decision\n- Consider who benefits from silence vs. who benefits from disclosure\n- Be honest about your own biases and limitations\n\nThis isn't a formula—it requires judgment, humility, and accepting that you might get it wrong.",
